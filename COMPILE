Please read these instructions, if you intent to build the RelView system from
source.

Since version 8.0, Relview uses the Kure library version 2 which implements
relations and the domain-specific language. Thus, many parts of the old
Relview system have been removed and/or relocated into the Kure library.

In order to compile Relview, you first have to build and install the Kure
library version 2 which is available from [1].

The installation of Relview itself is now rather easy due to the use of the
pkg-config utility. Using pkg-config you can easily check if Kure was installed
correctly. If the command

	$ pkg-config kure2 --modversion
	
returns without an error, kure2 is available and has the given version. 
Otherwise you should consider setting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.
This can be necessary if you installed Kure into a non-default place. In
this case, if your installation directory was <prefix>, then you should add 
<prefix>/lib/pkgconfig to PKG_CONFIG_PATH. Using the bourne-again shell (bash)
you could write:

	$ PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<prefix>/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH \
	     pkg-config kure2 --modversion
	     
If you encounter problems at this step, you should check your Kure installation
and consult pkg-config's manpage.

In order to configure Relview to install it into the default place, just type:

	$ ./configure
	
To install it somewhere else together with other versions of Relview, you could 
use:

	$ ./configure --prefix=<prefix> --program-suffix=<suffix>
	
This installs the binary into <prefix>/bin and the binary is called 
relview<suffix>, for instance, relview-8.1 or relview-svn.

After the configuration was successful, you can use

	$ make
	$ make install
	
to build and install Relview.

If you encounter any problems during configuration or compilation, please don't
hesitate to report your problems. All comments are very welcome!
